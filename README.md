# Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning model built to predict outcomes based on a dataset. The notebook showcases feature selection, model training, and evaluation. It uses Python with popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Dataset
The dataset used can be any structured dataset (CSV or Excel) suitable for regression or classification tasks.
Features (independent variables) are used to predict the target variable (dependent variable).
Example: predicting heart disease, stock prices, or student scores.
Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Encode categorical variables
Split dataset into training and test sets
Feature Selection
Identify important features using correlation, feature importance, or recursive methods
Model Training
Supports Regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
Supports Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
Evaluation
Regression metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score
Classification metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Visualizations: feature importance, predicted vs actual plots
Usage
Clone or download the notebook.
Open in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
Update the dataset path.
Run all cells sequentially to see preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation.

## Output
